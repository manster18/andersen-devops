# Create an ansible playbook that deploys the service to the VM.


## Running
```sh
ansible-playbook --vault-password-file vault-password.txt deploy.yml
```
* vault-password.txt - I placed file in root directory for education purpose (in real project that file must store in safe place)

## Project check
To check deployed project try from localhost:
```s
curl https://127.0.0.1:80
curl -XPOST -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"word":"just", "count": 5}' https://127.0.0.1:80
```
OR (from your own host to the target host)
```s
curl https://<host_ip>:80
curl -XPOST -H'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"word":"just", "count": 5}' https://<host_ip>:80
```
